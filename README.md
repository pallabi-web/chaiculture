## 🎨 Design Choices
I selected a warm, earth-toned color scheme to reflect the organic nature of tea while using gold accents to symbolize the "Royal" aspect of the brand. The layout is centered to keep the brand's tagline as the focal point, ensuring a seamless user experience that builds anticipation for the product launch.
